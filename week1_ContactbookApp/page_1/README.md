this contact book app project contains a *contacts page, a *contact details page and a *call screen.
every contact you press should have its own details page which is scrollable to see the call history
of that contact and pressing on the call icon makes a call to the person....

upon pressing the end call button the call ends and takes you back to the contacts page where you can 
choose to make another call ..

inside the source code there are two folders ; a figma_Ui and aftercode_shots.
the folders contains the figma ui images for the code and an android emulator shots of the code 
after it was written.respectively...

ps.
never mind the slight differences you find....huh this is me being spontaneous...
